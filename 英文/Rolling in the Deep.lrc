[00:05.11]There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:09.71]Reaching a fever pitch, it's bringing me out the dark
[00:14.28]Finally I can see you crystal clear
[00:19.01]Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
[00:23.45]See how I'll leave with every piece of you
[00:27.85]Don't underestimate the things that I will do
[00:32.56]There's a fire starting in my heart
[00:37.25]Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
[00:42.78]The scars of your love remind me of us
[00:47.22]They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
[00:51.82]The scars of your love they leave me breathless
[00:56.33]I can't help feeling
[00:58.78]We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:02.23](Never had met me)
[01:03.50]Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[01:06.93](Rolling in the deep)
[01:07.93]You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[01:10.78]Of your hands (never had met me)
[01:12.87]And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[01:15.25]To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[01:18.39]Baby, I have no story to be told
[01:22.73]But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
[01:27.57]Think of me in the depths of your despair
[01:32.06]Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
[01:36.55](You're gonna wish you)
[01:37.63]The scars of your love (never had met me)
[01:39.95]Remind me of us (tears are gonna fall)
[01:42.14]They keep me thinking (rolling in the deep)
[01:44.20]That we almost had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:46.96]The scars of your love (never had met me)
[01:49.07]They leave me breathless (tears are gonna fall)
[01:51.31]I can't help feeling (rolling in the deep)
[01:53.48]We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[01:57.25](Never had met me)
[01:58.61]Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[02:02.03](Rolling in the deep)
[02:02.81]You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[02:05.67]Of your hands (never had met me)
[02:07.79]And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[02:10.09]To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[02:12.09]We could've had it all
[02:16.42]Rolling in the deep
[02:21.13]You had my heart inside of your hand
[02:26.18]But you played it with a beating
[02:31.75]Throw your soul through every open door (whoa)
[02:36.24]Count your blessings to find what you look for (whoa)
[02:40.60]Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (whoa)
[02:45.09]You pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown
[02:49.92](You're gonna wish you never had met me)
[02:53.28]We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[02:57.65]We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
[03:03.22]It all, it all, it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[03:06.91]We could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[03:10.42](Never had met me)
[03:11.59]Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[03:14.87](Rolling in the deep)
[03:15.95]You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[03:18.84]Of your hands (never had met me)
[03:21.11]And you played it (tears are gonna fall)
[03:23.15]To the beat (rolling in the deep)
[03:25.20]Could've had it all (you're gonna wish you)
[03:28.68](Never had met me)
[03:29.96]Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall)
[03:33.38](Rolling in the deep)
[03:34.14]You had my heart inside (you're gonna wish you)
[03:36.98]Of your hands (never had met me)
[03:39.52]But you played it, you played it, you played it
[03:42.95]You played it to the beat
[03:45.06]
